/add backend/post-graphile/src

create a script /scripts/generate_certificate.sh that uses letsencrypt to create a certificate for simplyserved.app. 
this script should check if all dependencies are installed, and provide instructions on how to install on ubuntu if they are not.  

The cert should be stored under /local/certs/

Add a new tls module which app.js will load similar to the corsConfig.js. This module should enable ssl using the generated certificate
