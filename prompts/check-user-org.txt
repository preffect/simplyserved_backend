Add a new endpoint to the token-exchange service /check-user-organization

This endpoint should be similar to the token exchange endpoing. 
- use the same cors, tls config, and googleAuth token check.
- using the googleAuth token, extract the user email address and check to see a user exists with this email

if the user exists, return a hash {appUserID: '', organizationId: ''}

if appUser doesn't exist, or not attached to an organization, return null for those fields.
